# Matheroids For Everyone
My group from cs 240 at the University of Puget Sound made a website with a game, and I wanted to make the game easy to play for anyone, without having install XAMPP or whatever.

Just download and unzip the assets folder, game.php file, and stylesheet, and open game.php in a browser. Voila!

To change the gamemode, you can go into game.php and change the gamemode value at the top of the <script>. It's on line 52. There are a bunch of variables just below that which you can use to change the difficulty as well.
  
I may at some point add a UI on the page to set those variables but for now I have other finals I need to finish.

Enjoy!
